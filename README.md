How to utilize the requirments.txt to get the necessary dependencies:

To utilize the `requirements.txt` file to install the necessary dependencies for this project, this Python project you can use the `pip install -r` command. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**
   Before installing the dependencies, it's often a good practice to create and activate a virtual environment. This isolates a project's dependencies from the global Python environment.

   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment
   python -m venv venv

   # Activate the virtual environment
   # On Windows
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies Using `pip install -r`:**
   Once your virtual environment is active, you can use the `pip install -r` command to install the dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command reads the `requirements.txt` file and installs the listed packages and their specified versions.

3. **Verify Installation:**
   You can verify that the dependencies were installed successfully by running:

   ```bash
   pip list
   ```

   This will display a list of installed packages and their versions.

By following these steps, you ensure that your version of this project uses the specific versions of the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
